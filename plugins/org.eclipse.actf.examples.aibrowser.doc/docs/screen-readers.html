<h1>Using with Screen Readers</h1>
<p class="h1">
aiBrowser detects screen readers automatically when aiBrowser is launched, 
so the screen reader which you usually used should be running before aiBrowser is launched.
aiBrowser supports JAWS for Windows and Window-Eyes.

<dt>Voice Setting</dt>

<h3>Differences between using aiBrowser with JAWS and without JAWS</h3>
<dl class="h3">
  <dt>Appearance</dt>
  <dd>The appearance of aiBrowser when running with JAWS is slightly 
  different from that when running without JAWS. 
  The tree view, the audio description view, 
  and the address text form are hidden when running with JAWS, 
  to avoid double readings by aiBrowser and JAWS. </dd>
  <dt>Speak All function (Alt + Down Arrow)</dt>
  <dd>While executing the "speak all" function, 
  only text read by aiBrowser is shown instead of text in the browser. 
  </dd>
